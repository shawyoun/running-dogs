<h1>Rolling in the Deep</h1>
<h2>Adele</h2>

<p>There's a fire starting in my heart,<br/>
Reaching a fevered pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.<br/>
Finally, I can see you crystal clear,<br/>
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare,<br/>
See how I'll leave with every piece of you,<br/>
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.</p>

<p>There's a fire starting in my heart,<br/>
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark.</p>

<p>The scars of your love remind me of us,<br/>
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.<br/>
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless,<br/>
I can't help feeling,</p>

<p>We could have had it all,<br/>
(Your gonna wish you, never had met me)<br/>
Rolling in the deep,<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br/>
You had my heart inside your hand,<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
And you played it to the beat.<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)</p>

<p>Baby, I have no story to be told,<br/>
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn,<br/>
Think of me in the depths of your despair,<br/>
Making a home down there as mine sure won't be shared,</p>

<p>The scars of your love remind me of us,<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br/>
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless,<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
I can't help feeling,<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)</p>

<p>We could have had it all,<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
Rolling in the deep.<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br/>
You had my heart inside your hand,<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
And you played it to the beat.<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)</p>

<p>Could have had it all,<br/>
Rolling in the deep,<br/>
You had my heart inside of your hands,<br/>
But you played it with a beating.</p>

<p>Throw your soul through every open door,<br/>
Count your blessings to find what you look for.<br/>
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold,<br/>
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown.</p>

<p>(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
We could have had it all,<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br/>
We could have had it all.<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),<br/>
It all, it all, it all.<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)</p>

<p>We could have had it all,<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
Rolling in the deep.<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep<br/>
You had my heart inside of your hand,<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
And you played it to the beat.<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)</p>

<p>Could have had it all,<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
Rolling in the deep.<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br/>
You had my heart inside of your hands,<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me</p>

<p>But you played it,<br/>
You played it,<br/>
You played it,<br/>
You played it to the beat.</p>
